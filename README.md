# Local-Notes
A east-to-use local and private Notes-App without any bells and whistles.

## How to set up

Clone project and run

    cd server && npm install

    cd client && npm install

Since this runs on MongoDB, you'll have to setup a database called 

    notes-app
    
And a collection called

    notes
    
Run project

    cd server && npm start
    
    cd client && node server.js
